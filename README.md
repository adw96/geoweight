## Stats ###
Using statistical tools from survey sampling methodology, we were able to adjust for oversampled locations in the zircon record.

## Vision ##

Our long-term goal is to turn the tools that we used in this paper into a sequence of scripts and programs for geochemical analysis where geographic or temporal oversampling could, if uncorrected, distort the results. Please contact either of us if you think you could use this! I'm very interested in developing it further but won't do so if there's no interest from the community! Shoot me an email at adw96 [<(at)>] cornell [<(dot)>] edu with a brief description of what what you need and I'll begin generalising it for you.
